This test client is a simple functional test for WebRTC enabled Chrome build.

The following is necessary to run the test:
- A WebRTC Chrome binary.
- A peerconnection_server binary (make peerconnection_server).

It can be used in two scenarios:
1. Single client calling itself with the server test page
(peerconnection/samples/server/server_test.html) in loopback mode as a fake
client.
2. Call between two clients.

To start the test for scenario (1):
1. Start peerconnection_server.
2. Start the WebRTC Chrome build: $ <path_to_chome_binary>/chrome
--enable-media-stream --enable-p2papi --user-data-dir=<path_to_data>
<path_to_data> is where Chrome looks for all its states, use for example
"temp/chrome_webrtc_data". If you don't always start the browser from the same
directory, use an absolute path instead.
3. Open the server test page, ensure loopback is enabled, choose a name (for
example "loopback") and connect to the server.
4. Open the test page, connect to the server, select the loopback peer, click
call.

To start the test for scenario (2):
1. Start peerconnection_server.
2. Start the WebRTC Chrome build, see scenario (1).
3. Open the test page, connect to the server.
4. On another machine, start the WebRTC Chrome build.
5. Open the test page, connect to the server, select the other peer, click call.

Note 1: There is currently a limitation so that the camera device can only be
accessed once, even if in the same browser instance. Hence the need to use two
machines for scenario (2).

Note 2: The web page must normally be on a web server to be able to access the
camera for security reasons.
See http://blog.chromium.org/2008/12/security-in-depth-local-web-pages.html
for more details on this topic. This can be overridden with the flag
--allow-file-access-from-files, in which case running it over the file://
URI scheme works.

Note 3: It's possible to specify the server and name in the url:
.../webrtc.html?server=my_server&name=my_name
